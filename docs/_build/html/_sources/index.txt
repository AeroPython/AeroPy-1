Welcome to pyFOIL's documentation, an easy to use aerodynamic tool
===================================
Python interface for XFOIL. THe objective of this library is to be able to be
able to call XFOIL from Python iteratively for any simulation in a total of 4
lines total (one line for most uses). For a thorough explanation and tutorials
please check ...

This project was elaborated because of the need of optimizing an airfoil
according to its aerodynamic and structural performance (conference paper).
Contrary to available options such as XFLR5, pyXFOIL aims to be an open source
Python code. It is a quick and easy way to find the aerodynamic pressure and the
drag and lift coefficients through the use of MIT's XFOIL embedded in Python.
Contrary to the other libraries, pyXFOIL does not have a GUI and is intended
to be used in Python codes for optimizations or any other process that requires
several aerodynamic analysis.
