# pyXFOIL
Python interface for XFOIL. THe objective of this library is to be able to be able to call XFOIL from Python iteratively for any simulation in a total of 4 lines total (one line for most uses). For a thorough explanation and tutorials please check the pyXFOIL [Wiki](https://github.com/leal26/pyXFOIL/wiki)

The codes in this repository follow the conventions of [PEP 0008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
TODO list:
* fork other works for airfoil generation and merge with CST library
* correct amount of characters for PEP, 79
* verify if there are no tabs
* Make lifting line theory more brand
* Include Velocity in filename
* include option for elliptical distribution
* output_reader lacks Coordinates options
